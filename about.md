# About Me

Hi, I'm **João Mendes** — a **Microsoft 365 Development MVP** and **Senior SharePoint & Office 365 Solution Developer** based in **Porto, Portugal**.

I've spent over a decade building enterprise solutions on the Microsoft 365 platform, from custom SharePoint Framework (SPFx) web parts and extensions to full-stack applications powered by Microsoft Graph, Azure Functions, and React.

## What I Do

- **Microsoft 365 & SharePoint Development** — SPFx web parts, extensions, Adaptive Cards, Teams apps, and Copilot plugins
- **React & TypeScript** — Modern front-end development with Fluent UI, Formik, Jotai, and CSS-in-JS
- **AI & Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — Building MCP servers and connecting front-end apps to AI-powered tool layers
- **Microsoft Graph** — Deep integration with users, groups, mail, calendar, Teams, and schema extensions
- **Azure** — Functions, App Service, Entra ID authentication, and cloud architecture
- **Open Source & Community** — Active contributor to the [PnP](https://pnp.github.io/) community, including [sp-dev-fx-webparts](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts), [sp-dev-fx-controls-react](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-controls-react), [sp-dev-fx-property-controls](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-property-controls), and the [PnP Blog](https://pnp.github.io/blog/)

## Open Source

I've contributed to **239+ repositories** and earned GitHub achievements including **Arctic Code Vault Contributor**, **Pull Shark**, and **Pair Extraordinaire**.
